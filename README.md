收集一百首英文诗

### This is a learning project ...
with practical application. I plan to build a "github website" backed by a repository. The theme of the site will be a collection of 100 original poems. They might be drawn from the hundreds of poems I've written over the years, or may be tailored to an adopted voice (persona). We'll see.

In any case, I'm sure I will find the project instructive and interesting.
